class HTTPClient:
    """A transport with the settings every request is sent with, the rules for
    what happens after a redirect, and the state that belongs to a client.

    `transport` is any object with a `send()` method as `HTTPTransport.send()`;
    one it is given stays the caller's. Without one the client builds the
    transport the `SYSHTTP_DEFAULT_TRANSPORT` setting names, else an
    `HTTPTransport`, when it is made, and closes it with `close()` or at the
    end of a `with` block. `proxymap`, `ssl_context`, `proxy_ssl_context` and
    `verify` configure that `HTTPTransport` and are `ValueError` beside a
    transport of your own; `env` (default `HTTPEnv()`) is where the client and
    its transport read their settings. `headers` are sent with every request,
    request-specific headers merged over them by name, over a `User-Agent` of
    `user_agent` (`syshttp/<version>` by default) and `Accept: */*`.
    Every request gets `timeout=DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` (`(10, 60)` seconds) unless
    `timeout` here or in the call says otherwise (`None` waits without limit).
    `timeout` bounds each wait; `deadline` (seconds, `None` for no limit, the
    default) bounds the whole request: redirects, retries and the reading of
    the body included, each wait's timeout is held to the time that remains,
    and `TimeoutError` is raised once it has passed. A read already blocked can
    overrun it by at most the timeout of that wait.

    The client, not the transport, follows redirects. `GET`, `HEAD` and
    `OPTIONS` follow up to 30; a redirect that changes the scheme, host or
    port drops `Authorization`, `Cookie` and `Proxy-Authorization` (and nothing
    else; the jar's cookies are chosen again for each hop). Any other method is sent
    without following: a 307 or 308 (for `PROPFIND` also a 301, 302 or 303) to
    the same scheme, host and port is sent once more with the same method and
    body, and any other 3xx, a redirect to another origin or a second redirect
    raises `OSError(EIO)`.

    **State**, chosen by the host of the URL asked for (the origin), never by a
    proxy's or a gateway's. A client keeps the cookies its responses set, in
    memory and, with `cookies`, in a jar: `True` is a file jar under
    `jar.store_root()` by host, a string one key for every host, a jar object
    is used as given. `cookie_hosts` (default `SYSHTTP_COOKIE_HOSTS`) declares
    groups of hosts that share cookies. `tokens` is read the same way and
    becomes a per-request `Authorization` (`Bearer <token>`, or verbatim when
    it names a scheme) that follows no redirect to another origin. In
    `request()` (not in `redirect()`): `auth_provider.ensure(client, url)` runs
    first, its errors swallowed; the `SYSHTTP_HOOKS_<KEY>_PY` hooks run on the
    caller's URL, and a request a hook makes through the client runs none of
    them again (the guard is per thread); a status in `status_forcelist`, or a
    failed connection (`ConnectionError`), is retried up to `retries` times for
    a method that is safe to send twice, after `backoff` seconds doubled each
    time and never less than the `Retry-After` of the reply, and a status that
    outlasts the retries is returned, not raised."""
